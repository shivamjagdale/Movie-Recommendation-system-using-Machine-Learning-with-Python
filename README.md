Movie-Recommendation-system-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python

Here we recommend movies to watch to our users just like amazon prime and netflix does. 
We have various ways of reccomending but here we are going to use Content Based and Popularity Based. 
The project is kinda difficult and kinda complicated.

List of things to do here :- 
import all the libraries 
check for null values 
combine the columns. 
Tfidf vectorizer 
find similarity score
ask user's input 
create titles of movies 
find close match 
then final close match 
find index of that close match  
find similarity score
 sort in desc order 
 the the for loop
